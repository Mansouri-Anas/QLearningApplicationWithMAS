# ðŸ§  Q-Learning with Multi-Agent Systems for Path Finding in Grid Environments ðŸš€

This repository provides an exciting implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm from scratch, specifically designed to search for the best route from a starting point to a reward in a grid environment. In addition, it incorporates the power of multi-agent systems, where agents perform seperately the Q-Learning algorithm. ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository offers a comprehensive implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm, enhanced with the use of multi-agent particle systems, to navigate grid-based environments. The Q-Learning algorithm is a reinforcement learning technique that utilizes a Q-table to learn the optimal actions in each state. By iteratively exploring and updating the Q-values based on rewards and future expected rewards, the algorithm discovers the best route to maximize the cumulative reward.

In this implementation, the Q-Learning algorithm is complemented by a multi-agent system consisting of five agents. Each agent starts from a random point in the first column of the grid and collaboratively explores the environment to find the optimal route to maximize the cumulative reward.
